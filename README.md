# What is this
Stanford published a paper on battery cycle life prediction: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-019-0356-8
This a playground using the same data.

## What to look at

The [Classification notebook](Classification.ipynb) introduces the paper and dataset and performs classification. The [Regression notebook](Regression.ipynb) predicts cycle life.
